OGMercuryVision
===============



This is a SmartDashboard widget, created by the programming committee of FRC Team Mercury 1089. Using images pulled from an onboard Axis M1013 camera, it displays a camera feed, as well as a thresholded binary version used for vision processing. It then processes the binary image, returning data about targets, including distance and angle.
